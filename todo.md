Fix whitespace at bottom of logo being printed
Allow for support of more than 6 colours (preferably no limit for number of colours)
Make the parsing of the logo files less sensitive (especially to whitespace and stuff because right now, if you accidently put a space somewhere the whole program will crash)
Add more info
Allow for more customisation of displayInfo() such as allowing for colour to be picked
